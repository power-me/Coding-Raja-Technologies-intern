# Social-Media Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning

Depression and Anxiety Detection using NLP on Social Media Messages .

# Abstract

Social media platforms have become integral sources for expressing opinions, sentiments, and emotions on diverse topics. Analyzing this vast amount of textual data is challenging but holds immense value for businesses, brands, and researchers. This abstract introduces a machine learning (ML) approach to sentiment analysis on social media data.

The primary objective is to develop a robust sentiment analysis model capable of discerning and categorizing sentiments expressed in user-generated content on social media.

The methodology employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. Initially, data is collected from social media platforms, encompassing a range of user-generated texts. Preprocessing steps include tokenization, stemming, and removal of stop words. Feature extraction is performed using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings.

Several ML algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, or deep learning architectures like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) or Transformers, are trained on labeled datasets for sentiment classification. The model is fine-tuned iteratively to enhance performance.

# Food Classification Project
# Overview
This project is a food classification application that uses deep learning to identify various food items from images. The model is trained on a dataset consisting of 20 different food classes, enabling it to predict the type of food present in a given image.

# About Dataset
We have used Indian Food Classification Dataset.

It contains around 20 classes of Indian Food Items.

For each class it contains 130-350 images.
